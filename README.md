# mentorship-platform
Mentorship platform created as a final project for html css &amp; javascript course.
This is mix of several templates from w3schools, onepagelove.com etc. I did not created this entire site from scratch, only login page is created from scratch and every
other thing either existed on that template or it is implemented from another.
